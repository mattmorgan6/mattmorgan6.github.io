## Professional Experience

%%amazon-sde-ii-section%%

###### **Amazon, Software Development Engineer II** <br> *Jun 2025 – Present &nbsp;|&nbsp; Bellevue, WA*
- Architected a new distributed systems platform using AWS CDK, ECS, and Network Load Balancers, processing 3M+ TPS
(transactions per second) globally to calculate delivery dates for items in sub-50ms latency.
- Designed distributed orchestration algorithms and launched the "Add to Delivery" feature, processing 50M daily
requests while ensuring scalability and preventing race conditions in high concurrency scenarios.
- Reduced infrastructure costs by $4.7M annually by optimizing CloudWatch logging (55% cost reduction) and
implementing intelligent auto-scaling on fine-tuned compute resources by evaluating performance-cost tradeoffs.
- Built a code review MCP Server that saved an average of 1.2 engineering hours per flagged review across 6 teams.
- Led and mentored a new team member on a customer-facing migration project involving API design, cross-team
communication, deployments, and on-call procedures that resulted in on-time delivery with zero production incidents.

###### **Amazon, Software Development Engineer I** <br> *Feb 2024 – Jun 2025 &nbsp;|&nbsp; Bellevue, WA*
- Reduced overall delivery date calculation latency by 10% via parallel processing in Kotlin Coroutines and Java Futures.
- Ensured 100% availability during peak traffic events (Prime Day, Black Friday) by diagnosing and remediating
production infrastructure bottlenecks including disk saturation, IP exhaustion, and load balancer instability.
- Created a shadow traffic service and replicable environments that saved teams approximately 185 hours per month.
- Owned the design and build of the post-checkout use case for 30-minute delivery from ambiguous requirements.
