:: Hi there! ::
<br>

On New Year's Day, I determined my theme for 2022 would be <i>"The year of writing"</i>. I thought that if I built this site, I would be motivated to sit down and write ...or at least type... things down.

My main goal for this site was to write code that instantly converts markdown into aesthetic html pages. First, I found [gordonnl/markdown-blog-template repo](https://github.com/gordonnl/markdown-blog-template) to use for converting markdown to html. After adding some tailwind css and a navigation header, it was ready to go. While the goal was for me to easily write and publish posts, I ended up tinkering with post previews and other custom markdown-to-html conversion code all too often!

Some my recent yearly themes have been:
- [2025] Mindful Momentum
- [2024] Uplifting!
- [2023] Steps
- [2022] Writing

I hope you enjoy exploring the site!
